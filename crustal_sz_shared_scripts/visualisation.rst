Data can be visaulised either by converting the data sets into .nc format for visualisation in GIS software, or by generating a series of plots.

Visualising Final Products
---------------------------
To generate the GIS datafiles, set the save_arrays flag to true in `run_aggregate_weighted_branches.py`.
This will produce .nc files of the final output of the processing - that is the weighted branches if 
calculate_wegihted_mean_PPE has been selected, or for the selected branches if single branch processing
is used.
Each layer within the .nc is either a displacement threshold, showing to probability of exceeding it, or
a probability threshold, howing the displacement at that probability level.
Which layers to output are defined in the save_disp_prob_xarrays inputs, and so does not have to be the
same thresholds that you have processed the data at if you just need a few layers.

Additionally within `run_aggregate_weighted_branches.py` the flag `plot`, hazard curves for each site 
can be generated by selecting the make_hazard_curves flag.
This will produces curves for each site individually, with 12 sites per figure.
By default, all sites that have been requested to be processed will be plotted, in to order in which they
appear in the site geojson file.
Alternatively, by setting default_plot_order to False, it will read in only the sites present in the
plot_order_csv file, and plot those instead.

Comparitive plotting
--------------------

Scripts `08_run_compare_fault_models.py` and `09_run_compare_fault_branches.py` can be used to compare
the results from different outputs.
They are fundamentally the same scripts, with the key difference that 08 will compare different sets 
of weighted fault models (e.g. crustal models vs subduction zones), whereas 09 will compare disctrete
branches of the models (e.g. subduction b-value 1.1 vs subduction b-value 1.24).
