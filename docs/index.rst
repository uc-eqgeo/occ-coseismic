Our Changing Coast: Probabilistic cOseismic diSplacemenT hAazard modeL (POSTAL)  Title 2
========================================================================================

The Probailistic cOseismic diSplacemenT hAazard modeL (POSTAL) can provided hazard estiamtes for vertical land motion due to coseismic rupture.
POSTAL is an expansion of the proof of concept described in Delano et al. (2025), but optimised to work at national scales.
It is developed as part of the Te Ao Horihuri: Te Ao Hou | Our Changing Coast project to assess the hazard faced by coastal communites in New Zealand (Coastal POSTAL). 
Initially designed for use with the outputs of the New Zealand National Seismic Hazard Model, it can be used with any fault rupture sets provided in an OpenSHA format.
