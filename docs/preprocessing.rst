Preprocessing
=============

Preprocessing is basically the same for both fault types

You've got to start by selecting the site data that you want
------------------------------------------------------------

Which is easy to do iwth my lovely QGIS scripts

But then you move to the crustal scripts
----------------------------------------
.. include:: ../crustal/README.md

And also the subduction scripts
-------------------------------
Which should be straightforwards

.. include:: ../subduction/README.rst

Until you are ready for the POSTAL scripts
